# 🎬 Manim Animation Collection

Welcome to my personal collection of animations created using [Manim](https://www.manim.community/), the mathematical animation engine. This repository contains all the Python scripts I've written for generating cool math and concept-based visualizations.

## 📁 About This Repo

This repository includes various animation projects made while learning or experimenting with Manim. Each file is a separate animation and can be run individually.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Manim Community Edition**

## 🔧 How to Set Up

1. First, install Manim:

```bash
pip install manim
```

2. To render an animation from a file:
```bash
manim -pql filename.py SceneName
```
Replace:
filename.py with the name of your Python script
SceneName with the name of the animation class in that script

Example:
```bash
manim -pql circle_animation.py CircleScene
```
Use -pqh for high-quality rendering.

## 📂 File Overview

Here are some of the animations included:

-circle_animation.py – Simple animation of a circle growing

-graph_plot.py – Plotting a sine function

## 🙌 Why I Made This

I started learning Manim to better visualize and understand mathematical concepts. This repo helps me track my progress and share my work with others. Hopefully, it inspires someone else to pick up Manim too!
